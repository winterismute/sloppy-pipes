# Sloppy Pipes
Sourcecode for the [game jam version](https://itch.io/jam/gameloop-jam-01) of [Bruno Barbera's Sloppy Pipes](https://winterismute.itch.io/bruno-barberas-sloppy-pipes). The game was made in a few hours on a rainy Saturday using Haxe and [Haxeflixel](https://haxeflixel.com/).

## Instructions
Install Haxe+Haxeflixel as described in the official website. The game also requires the [Flixel Addons](https://haxeflixel.com/documentation/flixel-addons/) package. Install VSCode and the Haxe plugin: the project contains VSCode files hence you should then be able to easily open it.
To build, the code requires you to place 2 files under the folder assets/music (to be created):
- day.ogg
- night.ogg
which will be used in the Daylight and Night mode respectively. You can choose any song you want!
